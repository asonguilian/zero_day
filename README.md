**READ ME FILE FOR FIRST PROJECT USING VAGRANT**
This project will contain only *2 tasks*:
1. Creating a repository without a eadme, adding a readme using markdown and pushing it to the origin
2. discovering ssh and uname command inside ubuntu

I guess with this, i will be all set with my linux environment inside my windows OS. Now i regret having an entire linux OS. Waisted hard dsik space!
